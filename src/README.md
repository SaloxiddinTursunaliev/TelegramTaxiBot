# Use ZigZag's base for your bot!

If you are interested in how ZigZag works and you want to write a Python bot using ZigZag's base, you can do this:

Copy `install.sh`, `bot.py`, `locale.new.py`, `config.new.py`, `plugins/start.py`, `plugins/callback_handler.py`, `plugins/message_handler.py` and `launch.sh`, Clean those three plugins up, and use it for yourself :) 

Note: v2 is comming soon, and it will be a FULL RECODE of the project, BUT, I'm writing it in the best way I can, so the only small thing you need to do to the plugins you wrote for ZigZag, is to change its patterns (I mean @bot.handlemessage...). Just wanted you guys to know :) Full instructions will be published when the new update arrives.
